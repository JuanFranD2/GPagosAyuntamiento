A stream that emits multiple other streams one after another.

{\bfseries{NB}} Currently {\ttfamily combined-\/stream} works with streams version 1 only. There is ongoing effort to switch this library to streams version 2. Any help is welcome. \+:) Meanwhile you can explore other libraries that provide streams2 support with more or less compatibility with {\ttfamily combined-\/stream}.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://www.npmjs.com/package/combined-stream2}{\texttt{combined-\/stream2}}\+: A drop-\/in streams2-\/compatible replacement for the combined-\/stream module.
\item \href{https://www.npmjs.com/package/multistream}{\texttt{multistream}}\+: A stream that emits multiple other streams one after another.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{Readme.md_autotoc_md2128}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Installation}{Installation}}\label{Readme.md_autotoc_md2128}

\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ bash}
\DoxyCodeLine{npm\ install\ combined-\/stream}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{Readme.md_autotoc_md2129}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Usage}{Usage}}\label{Readme.md_autotoc_md2129}
Here is a simple example that shows how you can use combined-\/stream to combine two files into one\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ javascript}
\DoxyCodeLine{var\ CombinedStream\ =\ require('combined-\/stream');}
\DoxyCodeLine{var\ fs\ =\ require('fs');}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{var\ combinedStream\ =\ CombinedStream.create();}
\DoxyCodeLine{combinedStream.append(fs.createReadStream('file1.txt'));}
\DoxyCodeLine{combinedStream.append(fs.createReadStream('file2.txt'));}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{combinedStream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('combined.txt'));}

\end{DoxyCode}


While the example above works great, it will pause all source streams until they are needed. If you don\textquotesingle{}t want that to happen, you can set {\ttfamily pause\+Streams} to {\ttfamily false}\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ javascript}
\DoxyCodeLine{var\ CombinedStream\ =\ require('combined-\/stream');}
\DoxyCodeLine{var\ fs\ =\ require('fs');}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{var\ combinedStream\ =\ CombinedStream.create(\{pauseStreams:\ false\});}
\DoxyCodeLine{combinedStream.append(fs.createReadStream('file1.txt'));}
\DoxyCodeLine{combinedStream.append(fs.createReadStream('file2.txt'));}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{combinedStream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('combined.txt'));}

\end{DoxyCode}


However, what if you don\textquotesingle{}t have all the source streams yet, or you don\textquotesingle{}t want to allocate the resources (file descriptors, memory, etc.) for them right away? Well, in that case you can simply provide a callback that supplies the stream by calling a {\ttfamily next()} function\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ javascript}
\DoxyCodeLine{var\ CombinedStream\ =\ require('combined-\/stream');}
\DoxyCodeLine{var\ fs\ =\ require('fs');}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{var\ combinedStream\ =\ CombinedStream.create();}
\DoxyCodeLine{combinedStream.append(function(next)\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ next(fs.createReadStream('file1.txt'));}
\DoxyCodeLine{\});}
\DoxyCodeLine{combinedStream.append(function(next)\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ next(fs.createReadStream('file2.txt'));}
\DoxyCodeLine{\});}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{combinedStream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('combined.txt'));}

\end{DoxyCode}

\hypertarget{Readme.md_autotoc_md2131}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Combined\+Stream.\+create(\mbox{[}options\mbox{]})}{Combined\+Stream.\+create(\mbox{[}options\mbox{]})}}\label{Readme.md_autotoc_md2131}
Returns a new combined stream object. Available options are\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily max\+Data\+Size}
\item {\ttfamily pause\+Streams}
\end{DoxyItemize}

The effect of those options is described below.\hypertarget{Readme.md_autotoc_md2132}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{combined\+Stream.\+pause\+Streams = {\ttfamily true}}{combined\+Stream.\+pause\+Streams = {\ttfamily true}}}\label{Readme.md_autotoc_md2132}
Whether to apply back pressure to the underlaying streams. If set to {\ttfamily false}, the underlaying streams will never be paused. If set to {\ttfamily true}, the underlaying streams will be paused right after being appended, as well as when {\ttfamily delayed\+Stream.\+pipe()} wants to throttle.\hypertarget{Readme.md_autotoc_md2133}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{combined\+Stream.\+max\+Data\+Size = {\ttfamily 2 \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*} 1024 \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*} 1024}}{combined\+Stream.\+max\+Data\+Size = {\ttfamily 2 \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*} 1024 \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*} 1024}}}\label{Readme.md_autotoc_md2133}
The maximum amount of bytes (or characters) to buffer for all source streams. If this value is exceeded, {\ttfamily combined\+Stream} emits an `\textquotesingle{}error'\`{} event.\hypertarget{Readme.md_autotoc_md2134}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{combined\+Stream.\+data\+Size = {\ttfamily 0}}{combined\+Stream.\+data\+Size = {\ttfamily 0}}}\label{Readme.md_autotoc_md2134}
The amount of bytes (or characters) currently buffered by {\ttfamily combined\+Stream}.\hypertarget{Readme.md_autotoc_md2135}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{combined\+Stream.\+append(stream)}{combined\+Stream.\+append(stream)}}\label{Readme.md_autotoc_md2135}
Appends the given {\ttfamily stream} to the combined\+Stream object. If {\ttfamily pause\+Streams} is set to \`{}true, this stream will also be paused right away.

{\ttfamily streams} can also be a function that takes one parameter called {\ttfamily next}. {\ttfamily next} is a function that must be invoked in order to provide the {\ttfamily next} stream, see example above.

Regardless of how the {\ttfamily stream} is appended, combined-\/stream always attaches an `\textquotesingle{}error'\`{} listener to it, so you don\textquotesingle{}t have to do that manually.

Special case\+: {\ttfamily stream} can also be a String or Buffer.\hypertarget{Readme.md_autotoc_md2136}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{combined\+Stream.\+write(data)}{combined\+Stream.\+write(data)}}\label{Readme.md_autotoc_md2136}
You should not call this, {\ttfamily combined\+Stream} takes care of piping the appended streams into itself for you.\hypertarget{Readme.md_autotoc_md2137}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{combined\+Stream.\+resume()}{combined\+Stream.\+resume()}}\label{Readme.md_autotoc_md2137}
Causes {\ttfamily combined\+Stream} to start drain the streams it manages. The function is idempotent, and also emits a `\textquotesingle{}resume'\`{} event each time which usually goes to the stream that is currently being drained.\hypertarget{Readme.md_autotoc_md2138}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{combined\+Stream.\+pause();}{combined\+Stream.\+pause();}}\label{Readme.md_autotoc_md2138}
If {\ttfamily combined\+Stream.\+pause\+Streams} is set to {\ttfamily false}, this does nothing. Otherwise a `\textquotesingle{}pause'\`{} event is emitted, this goes to the stream that is currently being drained, so you can use it to apply back pressure.\hypertarget{Readme.md_autotoc_md2139}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{combined\+Stream.\+end();}{combined\+Stream.\+end();}}\label{Readme.md_autotoc_md2139}
Sets {\ttfamily combined\+Stream.\+writable} to false, emits an `\textquotesingle{}end'\`{} event, and removes all streams from the queue.\hypertarget{Readme.md_autotoc_md2140}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{combined\+Stream.\+destroy();}{combined\+Stream.\+destroy();}}\label{Readme.md_autotoc_md2140}
Same as {\ttfamily combined\+Stream.\+end()}, except it emits a `\textquotesingle{}close'{\ttfamily  event instead of }\textquotesingle{}end\textquotesingle{}\`{}.\hypertarget{Readme.md_autotoc_md2141}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{License}{License}}\label{Readme.md_autotoc_md2141}
