enum \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_brick_1_1_math_a5959c934b204c7bcb6766cfaea8ae101}{Rounding\+Mode}}}

Specifies a rounding behavior for numerical operations capable of discarding precision.

Each rounding mode indicates how the least significant returned digit of a rounded result is to be calculated. If fewer digits are returned than the digits needed to represent the exact numerical result, the discarded digits will be referred to as the discarded fraction regardless the digits\textquotesingle{} contribution to the value of the number. In other words, considered as a numerical value, the discarded fraction could have an absolute value greater than one. \begin{DoxyEnumFields}[2]{Enumerator}

HALF\+\_\+\+EVEN&Asserts that the requested operation has an exact result, hence no rounding is necessary.

If this rounding mode is specified on an operation that yields a result that cannot be represented at the requested scale, a Rounding\+Necessary\+Exception is thrown. Rounds away from zero.

Always increments the digit prior to a nonzero discarded fraction. Note that this rounding mode never decreases the magnitude of the calculated value. Rounds towards zero.

Never increments the digit prior to a discarded fraction (i.\+e., truncates). Note that this rounding mode never increases the magnitude of the calculated value. Rounds towards positive infinity.

If the result is positive, behaves as for UP; if negative, behaves as for DOWN. Note that this rounding mode never decreases the calculated value. Rounds towards negative infinity.

If the result is positive, behave as for DOWN; if negative, behave as for UP. Note that this rounding mode never increases the calculated value. Rounds towards "{}nearest neighbor"{} unless both neighbors are equidistant, in which case round up.

Behaves as for UP if the discarded fraction is \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}= 0.\+5; otherwise, behaves as for DOWN. Note that this is the rounding mode commonly taught at school. Rounds towards "{}nearest neighbor"{} unless both neighbors are equidistant, in which case round down.

Behaves as for UP if the discarded fraction is \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} 0.\+5; otherwise, behaves as for DOWN. Rounds towards "{}nearest neighbor"{} unless both neighbors are equidistant, in which case round towards positive infinity.

If the result is positive, behaves as for HALF\+\_\+\+UP; if negative, behaves as for HALF\+\_\+\+DOWN. Rounds towards "{}nearest neighbor"{} unless both neighbors are equidistant, in which case round towards negative infinity.

If the result is positive, behaves as for HALF\+\_\+\+DOWN; if negative, behaves as for HALF\+\_\+\+UP. Rounds towards the "{}nearest neighbor"{} unless both neighbors are equidistant, in which case rounds towards the even neighbor.

Behaves as for HALF\+\_\+\+UP if the digit to the left of the discarded fraction is odd; behaves as for HALF\+\_\+\+DOWN if it\textquotesingle{}s even.

Note that this is the rounding mode that statistically minimizes cumulative error when applied repeatedly over a sequence of calculations. It is sometimes known as "{}\+Banker\textquotesingle{}s rounding"{}, and is chiefly used in the USA. \\
