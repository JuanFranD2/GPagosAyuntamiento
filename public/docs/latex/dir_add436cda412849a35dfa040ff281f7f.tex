\href{https://travis-ci.org/guybedford/es-module-lexer}{\texttt{}}

A very fast JS Common\+JS module syntax lexer used to detect the most likely list of named exports of a Common\+JS module.

Outputs the list of named exports ({\ttfamily exports.\+name = ...}) and possible module reexports (`module.\+exports = require('...\textquotesingle{})\`{}), including the common transpiler variations of these cases.

Forked from \href{https://github.com/guybedford/es-module-lexer}{\texttt{https\+://github.\+com/guybedford/es-\/module-\/lexer}}.

{\itshape Comprehensively handles the JS language grammar while remaining small and fast. -\/ \texorpdfstring{$\sim$}{\string~}90ms per MB of JS cold and \texorpdfstring{$\sim$}{\string~}15ms per MB of JS warm, see benchmarks for more info.}\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md2006}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Project Status}{Project Status}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md2006}
This project is used in Node.\+js core for detecting the named exports available when importing a CJS module into ESM, and is maintained for this purpose.

PRs will be accepted and upstreamed for parser bugs, performance improvements or new syntax support only.

{\itshape Detection patterns for this project are {\bfseries{frozen}}}. This is because adding any new export detection patterns would result in fragmented backwards-\/compatibility. Specifically, it would be very difficult to figure out why an ES module named export for Common\+JS might work in newer Node.\+js versions but not older versions. This problem would only be discovered downstream of module authors, with the fix for module authors being to then have to understand which patterns in this project provide full backwards-\/compatibily. Rather, by fully freezing the detected patterns, if it works in any Node.\+js version it will work in any other. Build tools can also reliably treat the supported syntax for this project as a part of their output target for ensuring syntax support.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md2007}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Usage}{Usage}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md2007}

Common\+JS exports matches are run against the source token stream.

The token grammar is\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\end{DoxyCode}


Spacing between tokens is taken to be any ECMA-\/262 whitespace, ECMA-\/262 block comment or ECMA-\/262 line comment.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The returned export names are taken to be the combination of\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item All {\ttfamily IDENTIFIER} and {\ttfamily STRING\+\_\+\+LITERAL} slots for {\ttfamily EXPORTS\+\_\+\+MEMBER} and {\ttfamily EXPORTS\+\_\+\+LITERAL} matches.
\item The first {\ttfamily STRING\+\_\+\+LITERAL} slot for all {\ttfamily EXPORTS\+\_\+\+DEFINE\+\_\+\+VALUE} matches where that same string is not an {\ttfamily EXPORTS\+\_\+\+DEFINE} match that is not also an {\ttfamily EXPORTS\+\_\+\+DEFINE\+\_\+\+VALUE} match.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\item The reexport specifiers are taken to be the combination of\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item The {\ttfamily REQUIRE} matches of the last matched of either {\ttfamily MODULE\+\_\+\+EXPORTS\+\_\+\+ASSIGN} or {\ttfamily EXPORTS\+\_\+\+LITERAL}.
\item All {\itshape top-\/level} {\ttfamily EXPORT\+\_\+\+STAR} {\ttfamily REQUIRE} matches and {\ttfamily EXPORTS\+\_\+\+ASSIGN} matches whose {\ttfamily IDENTIFIER} also matches the first {\ttfamily IDENTIFIER} in {\ttfamily EXPORT\+\_\+\+STAR\+\_\+\+LIB}.

\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md2010}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Named Exports Parsing}{Named Exports Parsing}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md2010}
The basic matching rules for named exports are {\ttfamily exports.\+name}, `exports\mbox{[}\textquotesingle{}name'\mbox{]}{\ttfamily  or }Object.\+define\+Property(exports, \textquotesingle{}name\textquotesingle{}, ...)\`{}. This matching is done without scope analysis and regardless of the expression position\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\end{DoxyCode}


Because there is no scope analysis, the above detection may overclassify\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\end{DoxyCode}


It will in turn underclassify in cases where the identifiers are renamed\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md2011}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Getter Exports Parsing}{Getter Exports Parsing}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md2011}
{\ttfamily Object.\+define\+Property} is detected for specifically value and getter forms returning an identifier or member expression\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\end{DoxyCode}


Value properties are also detected specifically\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\end{DoxyCode}


To avoid matching getters that have side effects, any getter for an export name that does not support the forms above will opt-\/out of the getter matching\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\end{DoxyCode}


Alternative object definition structures or getter function bodies are not detected\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\end{DoxyCode}


{\ttfamily Object.\+define\+Properties} is also not supported.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md2012}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Exports Object Assignment}{Exports Object Assignment}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md2012}
A best-\/effort is made to detect {\ttfamily module.\+exports} object assignments, but because this is not a full parser, arbitrary expressions are not handled in the object parsing process.

Simple object definitions are supported\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\end{DoxyCode}


Object properties that are not identifiers or string expressions will bail out of the object detection, while spreads are ignored\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\end{DoxyCode}


{\ttfamily Object.\+define\+Properties} is not currently supported either.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md2013}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{module.\+exports reexport assignment}{module.\+exports reexport assignment}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md2013}
Any `module.\+exports = require(\textquotesingle{}mod')\`{} assignment is detected as a reexport, but only the last one is returned\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\end{DoxyCode}


This is to avoid over-\/classification in Webpack bundles with externals which include `module.\+exports = require(\textquotesingle{}external')\`{} in their source for every external dependency.

In exports object assignment, any spread of {\ttfamily require()} are detected as multiple separate reexports\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md2014}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Transpiler Re-\/exports}{Transpiler Re-\/exports}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md2014}
For named exports, transpiler output works well with the rules described above.

But for star re-\/exports, special care is taken to support common patterns of transpiler outputs from Babel and Type\+Script as well as bundlers like Rollup\+JS. These reexport and star reexport patterns are restricted to only be detected at the top-\/level as provided by the direct output of these tools.

For example, `export \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*} from \textquotesingle{}external'\`{} is output by Babel as\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\end{DoxyCode}


Where the {\ttfamily var \+\_\+external = require("{}external"{})} is specifically detected as well as the {\ttfamily Object.\+keys(\+\_\+external)} statement, down to the exact for of that entire expression including minor variations of the output. The {\ttfamily \+\_\+external} and {\ttfamily key} identifiers are carefully matched in this detection.

Similarly for Type\+Script, `export \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*} from \textquotesingle{}external'\`{} is output as\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\end{DoxyCode}


Where the {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+\_\+export(require("{}external"{}))} statement is explicitly detected as a reexport, including variations {\ttfamily tslib.\+\_\+\+\_\+export} and {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+\_\+export\+Star}.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md2015}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Environment Support}{Environment Support}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md2015}

To build download the WASI SDK from \href{https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk/releases}{\texttt{https\+://github.\+com/\+Web\+Assembly/wasi-\/sdk/releases}}.

The Makefile assumes the existence of "{}wasi-\/sdk-\/11.\+0"{} and "{}wabt"{} (optional) as sibling folders to this project.

The build through the Makefile is then run via {\ttfamily make lib/lexer.\+wasm}, which can also be triggered via {\ttfamily npm run build-\/wasm} to create {\ttfamily dist/lexer.\+js}.

On Windows it may be preferable to use the Linux subsystem.

After the Web Assembly build, the CJS build can be triggered via {\ttfamily npm run build}.

Optimization passes are run with \href{https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen}{\texttt{Binaryen}} prior to publish to reduce the Web Assembly footprint.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md2019}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{License}{License}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md2019}
